## Weekend To Do List


## Description

- This application uses a local server with a database to create a list of tasks.
- The client uses the inut and types out a task to be completed.
- They then click on the "Add Task" button and the data displays on the DOM and is stored in a DB.
- From there the user can click on the check-box for "Complete" or "Delete" button.
- The complete box will highlight the task and check the box.
- the Delete button will delete from DOM and DB.
